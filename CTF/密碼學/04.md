What does the following piece of code print to the screen?
print(len('Hello') + len('Hello'))

ANSWER: 10 (Both calls to len() return integer values, and the 5s add to the integer value 10, which is printed on the screen.)

What does this code print?
i = 0
while i < 3:
print('Hello')
i = i + 1

ANSWER: Hello
Hello
Hello

How about this code?
i = 0
spam = 'Hello'
while i < 5:
spam = spam + spam[i]
i = i + 1
print(spam)

ANSWER: HelloHello

And this?
i = 0
while i < 4:
while i < 6:
i = i + 2
print(i)

ANSWER: 2
4
6
```
